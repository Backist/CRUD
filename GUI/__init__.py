"""GUI Short Module to implement some User Interfaces to the main program."""

#Adding __init__.py to the folder will make it a package
#putting __init__.py in a directory (or subdirectory) will make it a package
#__init__.py is a special file that Python runs when it encounters a package
#TODO: For convenience, to clean the main program, i make this module as a package. (But not the best option because not to be honest a large program)
