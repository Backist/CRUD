# Data-Products GUI System With Sqlite3 (CRUD)

```This is my first work with a database (CRUD) with GUI implementation.```

## Characteristics:
- [x] The program implements a user interface (GUI).
- [x] The database has a small layer of security in which access to the database (enter data) is only allowed with a unique and private ``token`` that is stored in a ``temporary database`` which is checked each time the database is started.
- [x] External Tools to make the program more rich and complete such as ``Export Db``, *``Multi requests``, ``Export Users``, ``Create Backup``, *``Custom Proxy``, etc...

###### | * | -> Some tools are currently being developed

## Install dependencies
To use this program there are some libraries that aren't be in the ``Python Standard Library``.
To do this, simply type in the shell:
- **Windows (NT)**:
  - ``pip install -r requeriments.txt`` to install all dependencies in global context
  - ``pip install -r requeriments.txt --user`` to install the program dependencies in global context.
- **Linux (POSIX)**:
  - ``pip3 install -r requeriments.txt`` to install all dependencies in global context
  - ``pip3 install -r requeriments.txt --user`` to install the program dependencies in global context.

> **IMPORTANT:** This is my first time that together with the use of a database with a user interface, therefore, the program is likely or not to be well written or simply the program can be improved or simplified
