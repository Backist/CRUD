# Data-Products GUI System With Sqlite3

This small program is created to administer or manage product data and store it in a database.
The program allows multiple queries and to create different tables to store other data apart from the main data flow.
To make use of the database, first the user who uses the program or wants to start saving data in the database 
must create a user and then create a unique password as a method of access to the database.
